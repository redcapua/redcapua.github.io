I have been working in software development since 1996. Since 2010 I am involved in mobile app development for iOS and Android. I have rich experience <br>in development new apps and app maintenance: creating app from sketch, fixing issues, adding new features, <br>updating apps according new requirements of operation system or device features.<br>
<br>
As usual my duties are:<br>
<ul>
<li>reviewing project requirements and creating project specifications</li>
<li>creating architecture solution for single- or multi-platform (iOS + Android versions) application</li>
<li>prototyping for new applications</li>
<li>deploy new features & bug fixes</li>
<li>coordinate simultaneous work on many ongoing development projects</li>
<li>conducting the test cases on each supported device to find issues</li>
<li>integration of apps with webservices of web site, manage the design + development team</li>
<li>creating text and video manuals (instructions) about application using</li>
<li>publishing apps at stores. Beta testing and release</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>Mobile platforms:</b> iOS (Objective-C / Swift, full stack) & Android (Java, full stack)<br>
<b>Web-services (LAMP):</b> PHP + MySQL + JSON + Cloud databases like Firebase<br>

I continuously look for honing my skill, acquiring knowledge and learning about contemporary business practices. <br>At the moment I do learn developing with Python.<br><br>
I have developed since 2010 more than 30 mobile applications from specifications to upload to AppStore and Google Play Market and <br>have upgraded more than 50 applications for iOS and Android. Also I have my own apps published at AppStore and Google Play.
